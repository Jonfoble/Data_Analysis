Dataset Analysis with R, based on breast cancer.

Application Area and Data used:

The application area for the analysis is breast cancer. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set consists of 699 records of breast tissue samples, each with 10 features that describe the characteristics of the tissue. The features are all integer values and are normalized so that they are on a similar scale. The goal of the data set is to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on these features.

The data set includes two classes: benign (represented by the value "2") and malignant (represented by the value "4"). There are 458 benign tumors and 241 malignant tumors in the data set.

For my analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set, I will be using Generalized Linear Regression. This method is chosen based on its effectiveness for analyzing data in the field of breast cancer diagnosis and its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of a tumor being benign or malignant.

To measure the success of the Generalized Linear Regression method, we will use several criteria. First, we will look at the accuracy of the predictions made by the algorithm. This will involve comparing the predicted class of a tumor to its actual class and calculating the percentage of correct predictions. We will also consider the precision and recall of the predictions, which measure the balance between false positive and false negative errors.
